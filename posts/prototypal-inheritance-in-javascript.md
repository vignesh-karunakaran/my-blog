Before we getting into prototypal inheritance first, we will see what is  ```__proto__``` object?

Have you seen when you create an (object/array/string/function) that have some function /property in it?

In the above image, we used to create an object, where we can access some functions like ```hasOwnProperty``` which is not created by myself.

let we start from AST

```
let a = {};
```

Here `a` is the variable declared with ```ObjectExpression``` by which it creates new instance of ```constructor``` function called ```Object```, that's how the properties of ```Object``` get inherited into the variable 'a'.

Those inherited properties can be accessed by calling  ```a.__proto__```.

In basic ```__proto__``` is an object that has inherited properties from its parent object.


## Prototypal Inheritance:


When we search for a property that we didnâ€™t define in a variable it will travel in the prototype chain to find the property from its prototype chain which known as prototypal inheritance.


### Eg:-

``` 
let a = {}; 
```

when we didn't define any property in it, we can access the toString function from a.

where toString is the function which is the property of the Object.

What is the **prototype** and what is the difference between **prototype** and ```__proto__```?

The ```prototype``` is the object which can be found only in the ```constructor``` function, but the properties in the ```prototype``` can be accessed by the **instance** of the ```constructor``` function.

```__proto__``` is the object in every variable which **has** the inherited properties from its parent object.

**prototype** is the object which contains all properties which **will be** inherited to its instance.
