### From where to start?

The god may differs from religion/country, but all dots are connected with one single thread called as faith, miracles are still happening in everyone's life but still some deny to accept it, some will deny the denial by people who don't accept it, in this post i am not going to support or deny any religion/god, i am just searching myself with this question of `whoami` in a spritual from which i got some answers which will help others to gain a clear vision or  will help to skip some steps to attain true awareness.


I will start with from my birth,where i born at thaipoosam which is consider as special day for the people who is worshiping lord murugan (GOD), so from that moment after when i started walking my grand father filed
me in his vinakyar temple where he is so called as darma gata(In simple words - he is Manager for the temple), and he his devotee of Kirupanandha Variyar who is spritual teacher present in our nearby street,
so my grand father use to preach his miracles to me when i was in young, till my fiveth grade i use to study
in the temple there i observe everyone who comes to workship, i can judge there suffering with their intense of workship towards the god, but still some prayers are still unanswered., After my grand father passed away we switched the post to someone who is present nearby the temple who can able to manage the expense because at that time we had a financial crisis so with no choice we gave that posting to another person who is also spirtually active at that time, i started my question of `what is purpose of life?` from my grand father death who always trusted the natural godly power.

### What if i am a god and what is life?

Let say if i am a god even with all super natural powers it would be a void without any purpose, so as a god
i will create my own purpose to exist in the comical universe, to sustain my(god) purpose i divide myself as a every form of life with my(god) part of soul by that each life suffer, survive, blissed and gain an ultimate knowledge and i gives the purpose for that life to exist in this universe, if that life is didn't accomplish his purpose within his life span, he will attain to reborn till his/he completes the purpose given.

After the purpose got accomplished that soul will break birth cycle and be taken back to the higher form god which we call it as `moksha` from that soul i (god) will mine the knowledge even from rape victim to billionare and with that i will create another species / human / any life form to solve the more critical problem of his own life with that by parallel that life form should posses action to achieve its purpose.

As a god i will create people who belives in god and pray to him which will create a purpose of existence for the god and also i will create both atheist and agonstic people who will deny the creator's existence. because even religous or people who have belief won't recall the existence of god, but atheist and agonstic does it without their knowledge.

### To attain Enlightment:

From the ancient siddhars/rishis to modern world only way to attain enlightment is by meditation, though that we can awake enlightment by which we can posses ourself more awareness, sustain the excessive knowledge and even we can reprogram the reality with our enlightment it may sounds like conspiracy theory but for some it is the unacceptable truth, science is a new born baby where we categories unsolved mystics under quantum physics where we still can't figure out those answers, from occult to prayers everything is falls under one criteria which we call it as faith, the meditation well posses the higher form when we practice it with intense. their you will find the answer of void. concentrate on anahata at every moment if possible, their are many spritual people have attended their enlightment.

### My view on vallalar:

Vallalar is one of most famous saint when i was travelling to pattinathar temple in-between in street i saw an old building where from outside i saw a fire (ஜோதி) is burning in lamp, there is no statue or photo instead they are worshiping burning light in lamp as god i don't know it is public or place so i didn't visited that place at that time and i didn't notice it in deep, but soon after some day one of my senior colleague posted about vallalar in his feeds/status, after few days i saw some videos about vallalar, from that i can be sure that he would have attain the enlightment, even he reveals the kundalini as blissfull state for human kind.

### Conclusion:

Their are so many mystics and miracles are happening in universe, but we still searching for math to proof of random events, but we can't learn the math of this random event instead we can manipulate it with our consciousness and awareness which we can obtain it from the intense meditation, i am not concluding this topic, i may revist this content to change it with my upcoming events/experience in future, so don't take this
as a true knowledge, take this notes as a rough sketch to start your journey for enlightment.
