### From where to start?

The god may differ from religion/country, but all dots are connected with one single thread called as faith, miracles are still happening in everyone's life but still some deny to accept it, some will deny the denial by people who don't accept it, in this post i am not going to support any religion/god, i am just searching myself with this question of `whoami` in my spiritual path from which i got some answers which will help others to gain a clear vision or  will help to skip some steps to attain true awareness.


### What if i am a god and what is life?

Let say if i am a god even with all super natural powers it would be a void without any purpose, so as a god
i will create my own purpose to exist in this universe, to sustain my(god) purpose i divide myself as a every form of life with my(god) part of soul by that each life will suffer, survive, blissed and gain an ultimate knowledge and as a god i will provide a purpose for that life to exist in this universe, if that life fails to accomplish purpose within his life span, he will attain to reborn till that soul accomplishes the purpose given to that soul.

After the purpose got accomplished that soul will break birth cycle and be taken back to the higher form god which we call it as `moksha` from that soul i (god) will mine the knowledge even from rape victim to billionare and with that i will create another species / human / any life form to solve the more critical problem of his own life with that by parallel that life form should posses action to achieve its purpose.

As a god i will create people who belives in god and pray to him which will create a strong purpose of existence for the god and also i will create both atheist and agonstic people who will deny the creator's existence. because even religous or people who have belief won't recall the existence of god, but atheist and agonstic does it without their knowledge.

### To attain Enlightment:

From the ancient siddhars/rishis, to modern world only way to attain enlightment is by meditation, we can awake enlightment by which we can posses ourself more awareness, sustain the excessive knowledge and even we can reprogram the reality with our postive awareness and focus, it may sounds like crazy but for some it is the unacceptable truth, unsolved mystics in science is classifed under quantum physics where we still can't figure out those answers, from occult to prayers everything falls under one criteria which we call it as faith, the meditation well posses the higher form when we practice it with intense. their you will find the answer of void. concentrate on ajna at every moment if possible, their are many spiritual people have attended their enlightment.

### My view on vallalar:

Vallalar is one of most famous saint when i was travelling to pattinathar temple in-between in street i saw an old building where from outside i saw a fire (ஜோதி) is burning in lamp, there is no statue or photo instead they are worshiping burning light in lamp as god, i don't know it is public/private place so i didn't plan to visit that place at that time and i didn't notice it in deep, but soon after some day one of my senior colleague posted about vallalar in his feed/status, after few days i saw some videos about vallalar, from that i can be sure that he would have attain the enlightment, even he reveals the kundalini as blissfull state for human kind, and he had performed many miracles in his life time, he use to worship (ஜோதி) where it has no mass, it reacts only with oxygen molecules and form a bright ray which is visible and can react with any solid state,
in my view every state of atom's reaction is a power exhibit by unknown form of energy.

### Conclusion:

Their are so many mystics and miracles are happening in and arround universe, but we still searching for math to derive the random events, but we can't learn the math of this random event instead we can manipulate it with our higher consciousness and awareness which we can obtain it from the intense meditation, i am not concluding this topic, i may revist this content again to change it with my upcoming miracle experience in future, so don't take this as a end of the spritual roadmap, take this notes as a rough sketch to start your journey for enlightment.
